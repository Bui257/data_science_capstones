# Data Science Capstone Projects

## Introduction

This repository contains the code and documentation for my Data Science Capstone projects:

1. **Capstone 1: Impact of Humidity on Electricity Consumption**
   - This project explores the relationship between humidity levels and electricity consumption, utilizing statistical analysis and visualization to understand the potential impact of humidity on power usage.

2. **Capstone 2: Predicting Lipophilicity (logD) of Molecules**
   - Focused on predicting the lipophilicity (logD) of molecules, this project applies machine learning techniques, specifically Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Regressors, to predict this critical property based on molecular descriptors.
